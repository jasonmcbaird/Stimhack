Maybe only view this screen with X or less cards? 60?

Foreach card type:
    Sort
    Place first card image in top-left
        A set distance from side of screen or last column
        A set distance from the top of the screen
        If offscreen, shift to next row
        If still offscreen, something's gone screwy
        Lock width and height based on screen size
    Place second card image overlapping last image.
        Lock sides to first image.
        Lock top to a set distance down from first top.
        Lock width and height based on screen size

ColumnController object keeps track of all UIImageViews of a certain card type?
Separate icebreaker from program. Thus, five card types for each faction / each deck.

Netdek is a deckbuilding app for the card game called Android: Netrunner.

NECESSITIES
1. It allows users to view a full list of cards in the game.
2. It allows users to keep track of any number of "deck lists," sets of cards the user has put together for use in a specific match.
    A. Deck lists have restrictions on them:
        I. Each deck needs one "Identity." That card determines several aspects of the entire deck:
            a. Which side the deck is on: Runner or Corp.
                i. Runner decks cannot include Corp cards and vice-versa.
            b. Which faction the deck is of
                i. A deck can have any number of cards in its faction, regardless of Influence
            c. How much Influence the deck can spend.
                i. Each card from outside the deck's faction costs zero through five Influence
            d. The minimum number of cards in the deck.
    B. While building a deck, Netdek must allow the user to ignore most restrictions. They can go over the influence limit or have less cards in their deck than the minimum.
        I. However, breaking any rule marks the deck as "illegal."
        II. One rule cannot be broken even while building decks: No runner cards in corp decks and vice versa.
    C. Users must be able to add or remove any cards within the one rule.

STRETCH
S1. Users should be able to replicate a decklist to create different versions of the same theme.
        I. Users should be able to switch the identity of the deck even after it's built. That'll often make the deck illegal, of course.
S2. Users should be able to limit the full list of cards to only the sets they own.
S3. Netdek should have a screen for visual representation of the deck, with cards laid out by type, then cost
S4. Validate odd restriction modifiers (mostly influence modifiers). Alliance cards and The Professor and such will be funky.

BIG DESIGN
1. Change the name
